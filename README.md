# ▓▒░ TUBE-RIPPER DELUXE 2000 ░▒▓

A **local** YouTube downloader with a UI that looks like YouTube branding got
dragged through a 2003 warez keygen — chrome logo, candy-stripe progress bar,
scanlines, scrolling greetz, fake serial generator, victory chiptune. Under the
cheese it's a clean wrapper around [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)
and `ffmpeg`.

Paste a URL → **ANALYZE TARGET** → pick a quality → **RIP IT**. Files land in
`./downloads/`.

- **Single videos:** two one-click presets — **HIGHEST** (top resolution, auto-merges
  best audio) and **STANDARD** (≤1080p, smaller) — plus **AUDIO ONLY · MP3**. Need a
  specific stream? The subtle *▸ advanced* link reveals the full format ladder.
- **Playlists & channels:** paste a `playlist?list=…` or `@channel` URL and it
  switches to **batch mode** — preview the video list, optionally cap how many, pick
  one quality, and **RIP ALL**. Files are foldered per playlist with track numbers.
- **Browser auto-detect:** the SESSION COOKIES menu pre-selects whatever browser you
  opened the page in, so HD/4K works without fiddling. Override it if YouTube is
  logged in to a different browser on the host machine.
- **Save location:** defaults to your macOS **Downloads** folder. Change it in the
  **SAVE TO** box (type a path or hit **📁 BROWSE…** for a native Finder picker).
  Your choice is remembered. Destinations are confined to your home folder and
  external volumes (`/Volumes`) for safety. Override the default with the
  `DOWNLOAD_DIR` env var.

## Install as a Mac app (for the whole house)

Build a self-contained, **universal** `TubeRipper.app` that runs on both Apple
Silicon and Intel Macs with **nothing pre-installed** — Python, yt-dlp and ffmpeg
are all bundled inside:

```bash
packaging/build_app.sh
```

This produces `dist/TubeRipper-macOS.zip` (~128MB). Share that zip with any Mac in
your home. On each one:

1. Unzip, drag **TubeRipper.app** to Applications.
2. Double-click **“Open Me First.command”** once (clears the macOS quarantine and
   launches it). Or right-click the app → Open → Open.

The app opens in **its own native window** (a WKWebView — not your browser),
runs entirely locally, and is a real universal binary so it launches natively on
both Apple Silicon and Intel. It's ad-hoc signed — no Apple Developer account
needed; the one-time unblock is only because it's distributed outside the App Store.

See [packaging/INSTALL.txt](packaging/INSTALL.txt) for the end-user instructions
and [packaging/build_app.sh](packaging/build_app.sh) for how the bundle is built
(pinned versions of CPython / yt-dlp / ffmpeg are at the top of that script).

### Shipping updates

Installed apps check the `appcast.json` in this repo on launch and can install
code updates (changes to `server.py` / `index.html`) in place — one click,
auto-restart, no reinstall. Publishing is git-only (no `gh`/tokens):

```bash
packaging/release.sh 1.1.0 "What changed…"
git add -A && git commit -m "release v1.1.0" && git push
```

`release.sh` stamps the version, builds `releases/tuberipper-1.1.0.zip`, and
rewrites `appcast.json` to point at it. The push publishes it. Full details —
including the rare "major update" path for new bundled binaries — are in
[packaging/UPDATES.md](packaging/UPDATES.md).

## Or run from source

```bash
./start.sh
```

That ensures `yt-dlp` is installed (into a local `.venv` if needed), starts the
server, and opens <http://127.0.0.1:7654/> in your browser.

Already have `yt-dlp` on your PATH? You can skip the script:

```bash
python3 server.py        # then open http://127.0.0.1:7654/
```

## Requirements

- **Python 3** (system `python3` is fine)
- **ffmpeg** — `brew install ffmpeg` (already needed to merge HD video+audio and to make MP3s)
- **yt-dlp** — `start.sh` installs it for you, or `pip install yt-dlp` / `brew install yt-dlp`

## What the quality list means

- **PROGRESSIVE** — single file, video+audio already combined (usually ≤720p).
- **+AUDIO MERGE** — high-res video-only stream; the tool auto-grabs the best
  audio and merges them into an `.mp4` with ffmpeg. This is how you get 1080p/4K.
- **EXTRACT→MP3** — pulls audio only and re-encodes to MP3 (V0 quality).
- Raw audio streams (m4a/webm) are listed too if you want the original container.

## How it works

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `server.py` | stdlib HTTP server: `/api/info`, `/api/download`, `/api/progress`, `/api/open` |
| `index.html` | the keygen-hell single-page UI (no build step, no frameworks) |
| `start.sh` | installs yt-dlp if missing, launches, opens the browser |
| `downloads/` | where ripped files land |

Everything runs on `127.0.0.1` — nothing is uploaded anywhere; the only outbound
traffic is `yt-dlp` fetching from YouTube on your machine.
